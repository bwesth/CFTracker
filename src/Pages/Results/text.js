  their footprint to zero. While this is an unreachable goal in our modern world, there
  are many steps we can take in our lives to drop our emissions as much as possible. 
  Cutting down on long haul flights, travelling more by bike or on foot, changing your diet
  to be more carbon friendly, recyclying, installing LED lights and many more small changes
  can all have a positive impact on your carbon footprint, and help save our planet. 
  Our goal is to help you to do that.`,

  and so many more negative side effects that are dangerous to the planet, to human and animal life, and to our
  future. In 2020, the harsh wildfires in California and Australia can be attributed to increased global temperatures,
