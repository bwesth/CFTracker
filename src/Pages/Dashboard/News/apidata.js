T he company hired on a scientist who had researched climate change in the mid-1950s and continued to work on the subject within the company for years. Ford didnt just take no action on climate change; as with GM it worked against cleaner car regulations. The report is worth a read in full and brings to mind the opening discussions of David Halberstams wonderful book on Fords mismanagement during this time, The Reckoning . Halberstam starts the book recounting how an oil industry analyst visited each of the Big Three in mid-1973 on the eve of the OPEC crisis to warn these companies that energy prices would soon rise and theyd need to invest in fuel-efficient cars. Chrysler and Ford barely listened to his reports, GM refused to even have a meeting. We know how that went.

        'E&E News . Based on more than two dozen interviews with former employees, academics, and environmentalists, as well as examination of corporate documents, the report reveals that GM and Ford were "deeply and actively engaged" since the 1960s in understanding how their cars affected the climate, Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, said in a statement. "We also know that certainly by the 1980s and 1990s, the auto industry was involved in efforts to undermine climate science and stop progress to address climate change," Muffett said. The findings reveal parallels between the two automakers and ExxonMobil, E&E News noted. The oil and gas giant began conducting research in the 1970s that confirmed the occurrence of climate changeand the role of fossil fuels in accelerating itbut kept that research quiet . A GM scientist presented her findings to at least three high-level executives at the automaker, including a former chairman and CEO, according to the report. However, investigators were unable to confirm whether similar warnings reached the top level of Ford. 1996 General Motors EV1 A 1990 research paper by GM fellow Charles Amann suggested "battery-electric cars" as a solution to climate change, the report noted. But when GM launched its first production electric car in 1996, it was mainly in response to stricter California emissions standards, the report said. A Ford Ranger EV pickup truck launched in 1998 in response to those rules as well. GM became the first automaker to sign for action onto a United States',

New research to be launched by NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean today demonstrates that the gas industry has an outsized influence in the national political debate and that climate change concerns are pertinent despite the COVID-19 pandemic, says the Australia Institutes climate and energy program director Richie Merzian. The survey found 59 per cent of respondents wanted to see renewables lead an economic recovery, compared to 12 per cent who supported a gas-fired recovery. Credit: Bloomberg Excluding those who say they do not know, respondents on average believe gas mining and exploration makes up 8.2 per cent of the total workforce. In reality, gas mining and exploration employs less than 28,600 workers, making up less than 0.2 per cent of the 12.5 million people employed in Australia, says the report. On average, Australians believe the petroleum resources rent tax, which is the main way the federal government collects revenue from oil and gas companies selling state-owned resources, contributed 10.8 per cent to the Commonwealth budget for the 2018-19 year (excluding those who do not know). In reality, the tax contributed 0.2 per cent to the budget, $1.15 billion of the total $485 billion, it finds.

Monday, October 26, 2020The University of the West Indies (UWI) and the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC), are the first of five partners to sign contribution agreements with the Pan American Health Organizations Subregional office, to enhance coordination and increase the climate resilience of health systems in the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) community to better prepare and respond to climate threats. The initiative is funded by the European Union. The University of the West Indies will focus on creating an interdisciplinary cadre of 16 climate change fellows from across the region, trained in Climate Change, One Health and Leadership. It is expected that the establishment of this network will facilitate collaboration and support of local leadership initiatives spearheaded by the climate fellows under the programme. UWI will also assist PAHO in tracking the Caribbean public perceptions on climate and health over the next five years and increase public awareness and visibility. According to Chris Oura, a professor at the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the UWI-St Augustine and Chair of the Technical Working Group Climate Change and One Health Leadership, The UWI is really happy to partner with PAHO on this timely and important EU-funded project. Through our fellowship program, which we hope to kick-off in the first half of 2021, we plan to develop a cadre of leaders in Climate Change and Health from across the 16 participating countries.

Lucas White is the portfolio manager of the $220.3 million GMO Climate Change fund, which he "aggressively pushed" the firm to launch in 2015. White believes that the economics for clean energy are so compelling at this point that they will drive transformative changes in industries such as biofuels, electric vehicles, as well as solar and wind energy. He shares four top stock picks of companies that are both positioned to benefit from the climate change-driven trends. Visit Business Insider\'s homepage for more stories . Lucas White is not a die-hard climate change activist but he does want to save the environment and make money at the same time. "Unfortunately, the environmental situation is looking bleaker and bleaker, but on the positive side of the ledger, the costs for wind, solar, energy storage, electric vehicle batteries are falling very dramatically," White told Business Insider in an interview. In 2015, White started to push "aggressively" within GMO the investment firm co-founded by to launch a climate change strategy. Two years later, he and co-manager Thomas Hancock oversaw the launch of the now $220.3 million GMO Climate Change fund, which has allocated the majority of its assets to the clean energy and energy efficiency industries. "I don\'t know when the world is going to wake up to climate change," White said. "But even if it doesn\'t, the economics are so compelling for clean energy solutions at this point and they\'re going to be more compelling as time goes on, that the economics alone will drive transformative change in many of these industries."

        "Flood issues in Watford and other areas inherited and amplified by climate change By Letters to the Editor The recent flooding in Watford. Photo: Mayor of Watford comment It is unfortunate that some are still in denial about climate change and flooding. The problem is not what has been built in the past ten years but what has been built in the 200 years before that. Today all new build is required to ensure that the speed and quantity of rainwater leaving any piece of land runs no faster and is of no greater volume than that which occurred before the new build took place. Thats why for example if a front garden is made into a parking area it must be built to allow the rainwater to seep into the ground below and not run off into the street. Now we can all walk our local streets and see where this either happened before this requirement was made or has been ignored. And it all contributes to flooding as the amount of rainfall on some days simply exceeds the capacity of the drainage system of the roads. If new build adds to flooding, where is the evidence? A picture of a flooded street tells us there was a flood and not the cause of the flood. New build not only has to manage its rainwater but also build in a further 40 per cent capacity to allow for climate change, which causes it to rain perhaps less frequently but much harder when we have a storm. Mr Degen observes that there is not a flood agency as such. Well there is such a body; for Watford it is the Local Lead Flood Authority namely Hertfordshire County Council. And in addition to planning permission, all new build that drains into a watercourse needs HCC consent to do. Dealing with flood issues in 2020 is not a case of pass the parcel. But rather not adding to the flood issues inherited from the past 200 years and amplified by climate change. Roger Pidgeon",

But the US is set to withdraw from the agreement on 4 November, imperiling the treatys goal of limiting global heating to well below 2C, along with prospects for global action sufficient to ward off increased risk to the people and lands of the Caribbean . Hellshire Beach, where the marine ecosystem is rapidly eroding, offers insight into whats at stake for many Caribbean communities. Intensified storm activity and increased water temperatures are helping destroy offshore coral reefs that otherwise buffer the shoreline from pounding waves. The problems are compounded by unregulated commercial development and waste treatment, along with the removal of sand dunes and other vegetation. A landmark report published in 2012 found that Hellshire had lost up to 120 meters of shoreline in four decades. A seafood restaurant at Hellshire Beach. The sea is now perilously close to the businesses on the shore. Photograph: Christopher Serju When the scope of Hellshires destruction became clear, the government seemed ready to act quickly and decisively. A master plan to rehabilitate the beach was created but then dashed in 2016 when the Peoples National party (PNP) was swept from power. Since then, budding initiatives meant to invest in the beach have been consistently shut down, often without explanation. Jamaicas economic difficulties will thwart any short-term action to save the beach. The coronavirus has served a major blow to tourism and remittances, the countrys top two sources of revenue.

It projected a reduction in yields of 13% in West and Central Africa, 11% in North Africa and 8% in East and Southern Africa. African countries are generally low-income and ill-equipped to respond to this and other consequences of climate change, the WMO said. Natural disasters such as Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, which struck three countries in southern Africa in 2019, underscored the regions exposure, it said.

The cyclones forced more than two million people from their homes, killed many hundreds, and destroyed a half million hectares of crops in Mozambique. Meanwhile, in drought-prone areas including West Africas Sahel, the number of undernourished people has jumped by 45% since 2012, the organisation said. Climate change is compounding problems such as conflict to drive growing hunger. In the Horn of Africa, below-average rainfall in 2018 and 2019 led to the worst cereal harvest in Somalia since records began in 1995 and to crop failures in neighbouring Kenya. Floods followed. Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania recorded at least double their average seasonal rainfall in late 2019. The rain helped crops grow but also fuelled the locusts that have devoured hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in those countries since January. For now, the poorest are most affected. Africas overall gross domestic product will fall by between 2.25% and 12.12% as temperatures rise , according to a long-term impact study cited in the report.
