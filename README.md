## Project Description: A personal CO2 emission tracker tracker featuring:

### User login and persistent data 
Home-made backend functional but abandoned, waiting on Firebase server

### Pledges where users can commit to making changes in life-style for visually lowered footprint
Waiting on dependencies


## Team is currently working on:

### Firebase server setup
- Research ongoing

### CO2 data research, import, and logic
- Yaml file (tmorow) import waiting on Firebase server
- Arbitrary numbers manually generated (need to talk to Mads). 
- Pre-login survey prototype complete, but radial input options locked to context state - priority bug.

### Sass styling setup
- Initial research and setup complete, fixes pending before merging to master
